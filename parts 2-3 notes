Coldnt use (import) JUnit Assert class, therefore current value is printed in the test methods .   
I'm not sure how to send two request body parameters in a POST request via Postman, therefore I couldnt check
the relevant POST requests (with more than one request body parameters) appropriately . 


Test Classes had some significant changes and still unfinnished, while there are bugs to fix in POST request checkings .
